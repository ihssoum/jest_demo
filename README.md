This project is a backend API testing framework using Jest for a Spring Boot application. The application involves two main entities: AppUser and Task, with CRUD operations exposed via RESTful endpoints. The primary objective of this project is to test API endpoints for creating and managing users and tasks, without the need for a frontend. The project uses tools like Jest and Supertest for making HTTP requests and validating API responses.
